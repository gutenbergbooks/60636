  <h2 class='c003'>COL. JOHN HATCH GEORGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>When a biographer encounters the
duty of describing, in the abstract, a
character which demands greater elaboration
in order to do it reasonable justice,
he must be excused for the roughness
of the outlines, which, with the
proper shadings thrown in, would give
his descriptive picture more satisfactory
approximation to its required fidelity.
In the present instance limitation of
space, and partial opportunity to glean
matters of fact and incident suitable for
biographical record, justify the claim
on the reader for such excuse. In so
far as details are given, however, they
will be found correct.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>John Hatch George</span>, son of John
George, Esq., and Mary Hatch, his
wife by a second marriage, was born in
the house in Concord, N. H., now the
Colonel’s residence in that city, on the
twentieth day of November, 1824, and
is now, therefore, in his fifty-fifth year.
The native place of his father was Hopkinton,
but from his early manhood until
the period of his death he was a resident
in Concord, where he held the
common respect of the citizens as a
man of great energy and of unalloyed
integrity. He died in 1843. Mary
Hatch, mother of the subject of this
sketch, survived her husband four
years. She was a daughter of Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Hatch, Esq., of Greenland. Of the
same family were the father of Hon.
Albert R. Hatch of Portsmouth, and
the mother of John S. H. Frink, Esq.,
both of whom stand high in professional
and political relations in New Hampshire—worthy
descendants of a worthy
ancestry, noted for great native abilities,
honesty, industry and perseverance.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boyhood of Col. George, as
contemporaries say, was unmarked by
any special indication of that decided
description which sometimes heralds a
boy’s preference for a life pursuit. He
was slow neither at learning or at play.
If he had a prevailing passion it was
for the possession and care of domestic
animals, on which he lavished great
wealth of kindness, a quality which has
grown with his growth and strengthened
with his strength. His farm manager
is authority for the opinion that
“he would kill his animals with kindness
were they so unfortunate as to
have his constant personal attendance.”
His love for rural pursuits was a hereditament,
and also clings to him with increasing
vigor unto this day.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was educated at the public
schools in Concord, and was fitted for
college at the Old Academy in that
city.  He entered as a student at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Dartmouth college in 1840, without
having any special profession in future
view, and deported himself with credit
while there. When his father died,
some three years afterward, he had to
resign his college course, but his graduating
degree, and that of Master of
Arts, was subsequently conferred on
him by the Faculty of Dartmouth.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was fortunate for him, and largely
also due to the promising character of
young George, at this most important
period of his life, that his family enjoyed
the friendship of Ex-President
Franklin Pierce. All who were privileged
with the personal acquaintance of
that eminent man knew the peculiar
skill he had in the discovery of latent
merit among the youth whom he honored
with his friendship, and the more
than kindly interest he took in many,
who, only for his encouragement,
would have lacked the spirit to aspire.
Without previous consultation concerning
his inclination towards the study of
law, Gen. Pierce invited young George
to enter his office and prepare for admission
to the bar. That the youth
had what is called “a legal mind” had
been a quiet discovery made by his
friend and patron, who was then at the
head of the law-firm, in Concord, of
Pierce &amp; Fowler. Here, for three years,
Col. George applied himself diligently
to his studies, passed a reputable examination,
and was admitted to the bar
in 1846, and at once entered into partnership
with Gen. Peaslee, and on the
practice of law under the firm-name of
Peaslee and George, which united interest
continued until 1851, when he
formed a copartnership with Sidney
Webster, Esq.</p>

<p class='c005'>Prior to his majority Col. George
had been hovering round the verge of
politics, and, at every circuit of the
whirlpool he was drawn nearer to its
vortex. For many years, and with but
few interruptions, the Democracy had
guided the politics of New Hampshire
up to 1847, when the Colonel held his
first public office as clerk of the State
Senate. This office he filled in 1848,
and again in 1850. In 1849 he was
appointed Solicitor for the county of
Merrimack, re-appointed in 1854, and
removed by address, solely for political
reasons, in 1856.</p>

<p class='c005'>The same year in which he was
made Solicitor for Merrimack county
he was married to Miss Susan Ann
Brigham, daughter of Levi Brigham,
Esq., of Boston. Mrs. George died in
1863, leaving five children—three sons
and two daughters. In 1865 he was
again married to Miss Salvadora Meade
Graham, daughter of Col. James D.
Graham, of the United States Engineers.
He has had one daughter by
this marriage. His eldest son, John
Paul, graduated last year at Dartmouth
college, and is now studying at Harvard
Law School. His eldest daughter,
Jane Pierce, is married to Mr. H.
E. Bacon, of Portland, Maine, and his
second son, Charles Peaslee, is at the
United States Naval School at Annapolis,
Md. A son and daughter—Benjamin
Pierce and Ann Brigham—are at
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>Famous as the bar of New Hampshire
has been for its eminent men, few
of their number gained, so early in
their legal career as did Col. George,
such reputation for skill and devotion
to the interests of clients. His success
was remarkable, and yet it was simply
the meet reward of the most devoted
study and perseverance in professional
duty. Gifted with a powerful physical
organization he accomplished miracles
of labor in the legal and political fields.
He was fortunate in the sympathy and
aid he received in both relations from
his partners, Gen. Peaslee and Sidney
Webster, Esq., and until the latter gentleman,
in 1852, became the private
Secretary of President Franklin Pierce,
when the brief copartnery was dissolved.
In 1853 he formed another
partnership with Judge William L. Foster,
with which Hon. Charles P. Sanborn,
ex-Speaker of the New Hampshire
House of Representatives, subsequently
became associate. The firms
thus severally constituted held high
reputation in the locality and state, and
managed, with admirable skill, and
great success, many of the prominent
civil and criminal cases in Merrimack,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Grafton, and other counties in the state.
Our gleanings are defective in their
record of the leading cases—civil and
criminal—in which Col. George had
prominence as leading counsel, as public
prosecutor, or otherwise. He was
prosecutor in the case of State <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> Haskell,
a negro man, and wife, in 1855,
when sentence of death passed on Haskell
for murder, which doom was commuted
to imprisonment for life. Being
officially engaged on this trial the memory
of the writer enables him to state
that the conduct of this case by the
prosecutor was managed with great
skill, and without that redundancy of
immaterial testimony, and surplusage
of words in argument, which very often
render trial proceedings, which ought
to be of grave and dignified character,
almost ludicrous. Other capital cases,
defended by Col. George, and followed
by acquittals, were those of State <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i>
Scammel, tried in Grafton county;
State <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> Young, tried in Rockingham
county, and State <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> Sawyer, decided
in Grafton county. Among Col.
George’s more memorable civil cases
were those of Smith <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> the Boston,
Concord and Montreal railroad; Concord
railroad <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> Clough; Frost <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> the
city of Concord; Tufts’ Brick Company
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> Boston and Lowell railroad, and,
recently, and still unfinished, the suit
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and
the pier accident case at Salem.</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1851 and during the two succeeding
years, and again in 1856, he was
chairman of the Democratic state committee,
during which he did much active
service. He was especially prominent
in organizing the Presidential
campaign which resulted in the election
of his intimate personal friend—Gen.
Franklin Pierce. From 1852
until 1860 he was a member of the
national Democratic committee; and,
from 1853 until 1858, he was United
States Attorney for New Hampshire.
In 1853 he was elected a member of
the state legislature, but he resigned
his seat on accepting the appointment
of U. S. Attorney.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may properly be mentioned here
that Col. George had a narrow escape
from becoming Secretary for the territory
of Minnesota. That appointment
was offered him and accepted, and all
arrangements were made to enable him
to go to the north-west. On going to
Washington he was informed by President
Pierce that he need not hasten his
departure for a couple of weeks, nor
until the President and he should have
an opportunity to talk over old home
matters; but some business having
been left undone in New Hampshire
by the colonel, he sought permission to
return and complete it, for which he
had leave. On arriving at home such
was the pressure brought to bear on him
by his old clients, and such the importance
and value of new encouragements
presented him, as to induce him to give
up the Minnesota appointment and
resume his profession in Concord,
greatly to the satisfaction of his friends
in social, political and business relations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Although primarily, in his military
career, he was a member of that numerous
body which hold colonelcies by a
merely ornamental tenure, it cannot
be said of him that he “never set a
squadron in the field;” for, besides being
aid-de-camp and chief of staff of
Gov. Dinsmore during three years, up
to 1850, for several years from the organization
he commanded company A.
of the “Governor’s Horse Guards,”
one of the finest, best equipped and
most thoroughly drilled cavalry corps
in New England, and one in which the
people of the state had just pride.</p>

<p class='c005'>From 1847 until 1866, Col. George
was clerk and counsel for the Concord
railroad. In 1867 he moved his office to
Boston, he having accepted the position
of Solicitor for the Boston and Lowell
and associate railroads—a position he
now holds. He has a peculiar fitness for
this office, through his being thoroughly
conversant with railroads, their laws and
modes of their management. In February,
1870, at the special request of
the leading citizens of Concord, he delivered
a public address on “Railroads
and their Management,” which was exhaustive
of the subject and created
great local as well as wide national
interest. It was reported by a shorthand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>expert, published and extensively
circulated, and is held as reliable authority
regarding the theory of railroad
management. His connection with
railroads has been intimate and extended.
He is director of the Mount
Washington, the Profile and Franconia,
and also of the Peterborough railways.
He was one of the originators and earliest
advocates of the Concord and
Claremont and Contoocook Valley
roads, and has aided largely in the
construction of the various lines which
have conserved to Concord its centrality.
There are ways and means whereby
men receive much popular reputation
and credit for services as hollow and
objectless as those of Col. George were
substantial and valuable; yet it is but
just to say in behalf of the wise and
discriminating among our people that
they put the genuine patriotic value on
his efforts and esteem the man accordingly
as a people’s friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>Last year Col. George was appointed
a Trustee for the N. H. Asylum for the
Insane. He has largely and influentially
participated in local affairs in
Concord. For many years he labored
earnestly in the improvement of the
public schools, and took deep interest
in the elevation of the standard of education
taught therein. He invariably
upheld that the perfection of the
school buildings was essential, as a precursor
of the required improvement in
the educational course. Because of
this sentiment, he was employed on
building committees chosen to manage
the erection of several of our school
buildings, which, for completeness and
adaptability to their uses, Concord is so
justly noted. In 1877 he was chosen
a member of the Board of Education
of the Union District. In course of his
very active service in these relations,
he has never made pecuniary charge
on his fellow citizens for his labors,
whether rendered as a lawyer or as a
citizen. If the city records bear any
evidence of such charge having been
recognized, whatever it may be, the
amount was never received by the colonel,
but went back to the city schools
in some shape or another, useful and
necessary. When the effort to remove
the State Capitol was made, he
exerted every energy in his power to
prevent the success of this design, and
labored with great diligence and self
sacrifice in that direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>As previously stated, Col. George
entered the arena of politics almost at
the outset of his active life. Nature
and mental acquirements combined to
give him prominence in politics while
yet almost a youth. His recognized
energy and executive skill gave him
the chairmanship of the committee
appointed to receive President Franklin
Pierce on his visit to his native State
and home in 1854, and many will recollect
the success attending that great
event. In 1859 he was the Democratic
nominee as candidate to represent
the Second District in the House of
Representatives of the United States,
but failed of an election. In 1863 he
was again nominated for that office,
and made a vigorous canvass of the
district—making twelve addresses per
week during a month or more—but
was again defeated after a very close
vote. In 1866 he was the nominee of
the Democratic members of the legislature
of that year as candidate for the
United States Senate. His fellow
Democrats gave him the full strength
of their vote, but the Republicans were
largely in the majority against him.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man may be mistaken in his notions,
and be very earnest and persistent
in their assertion, but he will be always
respected when his views are believed
to be honestly entertained and pronounced.
The people only hold in
contempt a man who has convictions,
and who is afraid to express them when
circumstances demand their explanation.
Col. George is no such man. He
is credited with thinking profoundly of
what he says, and saying firmly what he
has thought. He may offend men’s
opinions or prejudices by what he says,
but he seldom or ever loses their respect,
because of their conviction of his
rigid honesty of argument or purpose.
Socially speaking, and notwithstanding
his variance in political opinion with
the majority of his fellow citizens of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Concord, no public man can count
more devoted personal friends and
admirers amid his political opponents
than he. His experiences have proved
the falsity of the poet’s contrary assertion,
and that honesty is not a ragged
virtue, but a covering which no good
and patriotic man, and worthy citizen,
can reputably refuse or decline to wear.
In all respects, aside from politics or
matters of public dispute, Col. George’s
social character stands high among his
fellow citizens.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “brethren of the mystic tie”
have in him an exalted member of
their most worthy fraternity. He exists
among their number as a “Sovereign
Grand Inspector” of the 33d and final
degree in Masonry, and as an active
member of the “Supreme Council of
the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite
of the Northern Jurisdiction of the
United States,” and has taken all the
lower degrees. He is a member of
the Blazing Star Lodge, and of the
Mount Horeb Commandery of Concord,
and was, for several years, Commander
of the latter organization. Of
most of our local charities, he is a
quiet but liberal supporter; and the
incidental demands of benevolence
find him always a ready friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notwithstanding the great pressure
of professional and other duties, much
attention is given by Col. George to agriculture,
and those improvements connected
therewith, sanctioned alike by
modern science and experience. He
owns a fine farm just over the western
boundary of Concord, in the town of
Hopkinton, where the improvement
and enrichment of the soil, and the
breeding and raising of horses and Jersey
cattle form part of his summer pursuits.
It is not certain that he will add
largely to his fortune by his efforts as a
“gentleman farmer;” but the external
aspects of his management are such as
to make those efforts valuable, at least,
as examples. His rules providing for
cleanliness, comfort and kindness towards
his farm animals are seen in their
fine condition, and reported to be profitably
justified by their superior produce.
No better proof of a man’s nobility in
the ranks of humanity can be found
than in his kindness towards his dumb
animals.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now, in conclusion, a few words
as to Col. George’s status as a politician
and a lawyer. As has already been
shown he is a Democrat. Keeping always
in view the foundation principles
on which that policy rests, he is what
may be properly called a progressionist.
He recognizes—what many cannot
do—the fact that the science of
politics advances, as does every other,
and that, while fundamental principles
never vary, circumstances occur to
change the rigid rule of their application,
though not to materially vitiate its
force or shut it out of due consideration.
The political influences of today
may not be fit to govern in what those
of tomorrow may demand; and he
can only be a narrow-minded man who
can think otherwise and act accordingly.
He certainly can have no pure element
of statesmanship within him.
But associated with this progressiveness
there is no feature of vacillation
or radical change and departure from
the organic principles of his party in
Col. George. He is as true as steel to
both, and no man among the Democracy
of New Hampshire has a larger
share of the confidence and respect of
his compatriots. His public addresses
are held by his admirers as models of
honest, terse, pertinent and well-judged
and founded argument; and he certainly
carries an audience along with
him, not by the use of clap-trap and
sensationalism, but by the bold, acutely
analytical, and forcible representation
of sound logical facts. He is held to
be one of the most solid, as well as
most influential, stump speakers in New
Hampshire, and his political opponents
do not deny this. His memory acts as
an encyclopedia of political history,
state and national, and this always gives
him wonderful advantage as an impromptu
orator—a duty he has invariably
to attend to when many or few are
met together for political deliberation.</p>

<p class='c005'>When his reputation and character
as a lawyer comes up the writer confesses
that the task of describing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>latter puzzles him somewhat. There is
no room for hesitation in saying that,
in eminence of ability, determination
in arranging the means of success,
preparation to meet and confute opposing
arguments, and unwavering general
devotion to what he deems the just interests
of his clients, no professional
man in New England is more than his
peer. To gainsay this fact would be to
controvert the opinions of the best men
on the bench and at the bar, and to attribute
solely to friendly admiration
what is assuredly a well recognized
truth. So much for reputation; but
what can, or should, be said as to Col.
George’s manner as a lawyer? It is
confident, aggressive, bold and independent
of every consideration but directness;
it shows no aspect of favor for
aught but the purpose in issue. Something
has been here recorded of the
qualities of his political addresses. The
same bold fearlessness of men, and of
opposing opinions, the same integrity
of sentiment and expression, the same
disregard of what offence the truth, as
he views it, may give to the opposition,
are characteristic of him as a pleader at
law. Here, also, what may, and does
seem to sound harshly from his lips is
materially reconciled to the listener’s favorable
judgment by the pleader’s manifest
earnestness, honesty and unadulterated
devotion to the truth, and the
interest of his client, founded on his
views thereof. There is no surplusage
of words in Col. George’s legal prelections.
He is a very Gradgrind for facts,
and uses them always with direct and
sledge-hammer force, cultivating catapult
pith rather than the pelting of his
opposition with roses. Every energy
is directed towards power and conquering
effect. To use the expression of
one who thoroughly knows the subject
of this imperfect sketch: “the man in
trouble who has Col. George for his
friend and advocate is lucky indeed:
he who is in legal difficulty, and has
him to oppose him is assuredly to be
pitied.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Col. George is of robust build, about
five feet ten inches in height, approximates
two hundred pounds weight, is
of strong constitution, enjoys excellent
health, has immense working power of
mind and body; and, if all reports are
true, it is not likely that he will live a
long and active life and go “over the
hill to the poor-house” at its close.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><em>MARCH.</em></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>BY ALICE ESTELLE FRIESE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was a fierce, wild March night.
One can fancy such scenes quite comfortably
in cheerful, well-lighted, close-curtained
rooms; but to breast the
driving storm of sleet and rain outside,
is quite another matter. So thought
Mr. Thorpe, a respectable tradesman
in the thriving, bustling town of L——
as he hurried on through the darkness,
and the ever increasing violence of the
gale.</p>

<p class='c005'>Visions of the cosy parlor, with its
tempting tea-table so daintily arranged,
and the pretty, charming wife who presides
so gracefully, flit across his brain;
but even their alluring promises cannot
blind him as to the discomforts of
the present; and with a gasp of despair
he tucks the wreck of an umbrella
under his arm, buttons his heavy
coat closer around him, and strides on
through the gloom. No one is astir
tonight; no sign of life meets him in
the usually well-filled streets. “Everyone
is safely housed, but myself,” he
mutters to the unpitying darkness. But
even as he is speaking, a form, tall and
slight, starts out from the shadows a
few paces ahead, and pauses for a flash
of time under the uncertain light of the
solitary street-lamp, which lamps in
our aspiring villages are placed at undeterminable
distances from each
other, wherever one long straggling
street happens to meet another, seeming
to say to the night pedestrian,
“you have safely traversed the impenetrable
darkness thus far, behold I invite
you to a continuation of the same.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As the figure, evidently a woman’s,
stands thus for a moment clearly defined
against the dark background, Mr.
Thorpe is half inclined to fancy that it
turns to meet his advancing steps with
a gesture of entreaty; then suddenly
and swiftly glides on, and is lost from
sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>I say he is inclined to fancy that she
appealed to him for aid; but being an
extremely practical man, he never allows
himself such vagaries; so he banishes
the fancy, and hurries on. At
last he has reached his own home. The
cheery, welcoming light streaming out
from the windows, sends a cheerful,
happy feeling through his entire being;
and with a laugh of defiance at the
mad fury of the storm, he springs up
the steps to the sheltering porch, when
suddenly at his very door his foot
touches something soft and yielding,
while at the same time, a little troubled
cry is heard, mingled with the weird,
uncanny voices of the wind. Half in
wonder, half in fear he seizes a mysterious
bundle at his feet, and presently
appears before the astonished gaze of
his wife, half drenched with the storm,
a hopeless expression of bewilderment
and perplexity upon his countenance,
while in his arms he holds out for her
inspection the same mysterious bundle,
from which various small cries issue,
from time to time, at irregular intervals.
The contents of the aforesaid
bundle being duly examined, they
prove none other than a round-faced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>charmingly beautiful, black eyed baby
girl. There is nothing in the “make-up”
of the child or its wardrobe that
even the most fastidious might criticise;
every article of clothing is of the
finest texture, and delicately wrought.
Evidently this is a waif from the very
lap of luxury, and refinement; and yet
an outcast and homeless.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tenderly, lovingly, pretty Mrs.
Thorpe touches and caresses the little
stranger, saying half hesitatingly, “we
will care for her tonight, Charles, and
tomorrow we must make an effort to
find her parents; or if they cannot be
found, perhaps the matron of the orphans’
home would take her; she seems
so unusually interesting, that I should
like to be sure she is well cared for, if
no one is to claim her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Claim her!” impatiently interrupts
Mr. Thorpe; “You talk like a woman!
As if any one ever claimed what they
were glad to be rid of.” “But,”—his
voice softening a little as he spoke, for
in spite of himself the remembrance of
the unknown woman under the street-lamp,
and her mute appeal to him for
sympathy and help, clings to him; and
for once, without arriving at his conclusion
by a careful method of reasoning,
very unlike his usual self, he in some
strange, undefined way, closely associates
in his mind the memory of this
woman, and the presence of the little
stranger in his home—</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Mary, you might as well keep
the child; she seems as well disposed
as such afflictions usually are, and although
I don’t approve of babies, and
therefore wash my hands of the whole
affair, still it might be a good thing for
you; the vacant place in the household,
you know, will at last be filled.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Still later, after Mrs. Thorpe had succeeded
in coaxing the smiles to chase
away the tears, and to play hide and
seek among the convenient dimples in
the baby’s cheeks and chin, she ventures
the question, “What shall we call
her?” for of course every baby must
have a name.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Call her March; it would be quite
apropos,” suggests her husband quickly.
“Yes, but,” said Mrs. Thorpe, “it
seems almost like an evil omen to give
her such a dreary, cheerless name.”
“Nonsense, my love,” returns Mr.
Thorpe, “What’s in a name?” And so
it is settled, and baby March henceforth
becomes an important member of
the Thorpe household.</p>

<p class='c005'>If I were giving a sermon, instead of
attempting to write a story, I should
here remark that Mrs. Thorpe was of
the type of women that many men
most desire for a wife—pretty, gentle,
submissive, yielding, and for the good
of the human race in general. I would
urge the fair sex to fashion themselves
in an entirely different mould; and,
whether matron or maid, to stand firm
and self-reliant in their own true
womanhood; for, although these shy,
helpless, clinging ways may seem to
the masterful lover the very embodiment
of womanly grace, yet they only
tend to make the one selfish and arrogant,
and the other abject and unwomanly.
But as such is not my purpose,
I shall leave all this unsaid, and
proceed at once with the story.</p>

<p class='c005'>Time drags wearily with the heavy-hearted,
and all too quickly speeds
with the gay. To Mr. Thorpe’s quiet
home it has brought no sudden transformation.
The head of the house has
gone on in his matter-of-fact way, adding,
year by year, to his well-filled coffers,
until he has come to be acknowledged
in business parlance, “one of
the heaviest men of the town,” which
is quite as true literally. Mrs. Thorpe,
the matron, is as charming and pretty
as the Mrs. Thorpe of earlier years;
while March has grown from babyhood
past childhood into dawning womanhood,
the pet and idol of the home.
No clue has ever been given as to her
mysterious advent among them; no
trace of the unknown woman who, solitary
and alone, traversed the deserted
streets on that wild March night. Incredulous
people have long since
ceased to regard this phase of the
night’s experience. For how could any
strange person, and a woman, go in
and out among them, without the fact
being noted and commented upon by
some of the news-mongers. An utterly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>impracticable story! Thus the matter
has been satisfactorily settled to
their minds. And even Mr. Thorpe,
from puzzling over the perplexing
question so long, has been inclined to
doubt its reality, and has even allowed
himself to think that possibly it might
have been a sort of optical illusion; or,
more improbable still, an unreal presence
from the shadowy land, supposed
to be inhabited by the guardian attendants
of finite creatures, and conditions.
But be that as it may, he has
somehow during these years fallen a
victim to the strange lovableness and
fascinating wiles of his adopted daughter;
and has grown fonder of her than
he would be willing to acknowledge.</p>

<p class='c005'>A rare, beautiful creature she certainly
has become, with a dusky, richly
colored style of beauty quite unknown
among the passionless, phlegmatic people
of our sturdy north. A form,
slight, childlike, with a peculiar undulating
grace of movement, a complexion
brown as the nuts of our own forests,
yet crimson as the reddest rose;
wavy masses of ebon hair, catching odd
gleams in the sunlight, blue-black and
purplish like a raven’s wing, eyes capable
of wonderful transitions, now full of
joy, laughter, and sunshine, now flashing
scorn and defiance, or heavy with
midnight gloom. A strange child, full
of wild vagaries and incontrolable impulses.
Mrs. Thorpe could no more
understand her nature or check her
fierce impetuosity, than she could with
her weak hands stay the torrent of the
mountain stream, or control the headlong
speed of the wind, as it eddies
and whirls in its mad dance. And so,
unchecked and unrestrained, March
has entered upon her regal, imperious
womanhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>Naturally, of course, there are many
manly hearts eager to pay homage
at so fair a shrine; but Mr. Thorpe
with paternal pride, has set his heart on
securing an eligible partner for his
darling. And so it begins to be rumored
around town, that Hon. Elwyn
Reeves has out-distanced all competitors,
and is in fact, the betrothed husband
of the beautiful March. To be
sure, he is her senior by many years,
but he comes from a long line of aristocratic
ancestors, and has added to
his proud name a princely fortune, as
his solid, elegant home, away upon the
hill, frowning in its imposing stateliness
upon its humbler, less aspiring neighbors,
attests.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A very good match indeed, considering
her mysterious and somewhat
doubtful parentage, a remarkable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</span></i>
of fortune for her;” say anxious
mammas and disappointed maidens.
Mr. Thorpe is pre-eminently satisfied,
and if March herself shows no gratification
in regard to her good fortune, it is
to be attributed to her peculiar disposition,
at times so reticent and reserved.
Thus Mr. Thorpe quiets any scruples
he may have entertained as he remembers
how listlessly and wearily March
replied, when he had mentioned Mr.
Reeves’ proposal, and dwelt warmly upon
the happiness in store for her as his
wife. “It shall be as you wish, papa,
you may, if you desire it, give Mr.
Reeves a favorable answer when he
calls.” But of course she was happy;
any sensible person would be with such
a future in anticipation.</p>

<p class='c005'>All are therefore quite unprepared
for the announcement that Mrs. Thorpe
with ashen face, and broken, quivering
voice, first communicates to her husband,
that the servants quickly catch
up and carry into the streets; that in
an incredibly short time is upon every
tongue—March has left them, as mysteriously
and silently as she came
among them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where had she gone, and why?”
These were questions with which speculative
minds were for sometime busy,
and anxious. Questions which were
never answered to them. She had
gone, leaving no trace behind. In a
little note addressed to her foster-parents,
she left them her dear love and a
farewell. She should never, never forget
their goodness and tenderness to
her; she had been happy with them,
but she had chosen for herself another
life, and a happier, and she must needs
live it. That was all. After a while
other faces came, and crowded the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>memory of hers away. The house on
the hill soon found a mistress, who
brought to her husband as a dower in
the place of March’s queenly beauty, a
fortune equal in magnificence to that
of its owner, and so he was content.
It is one of the laws of compensation
that gives one good in the place of another
taken. Only Mr. and Mrs.
Thorpe long remembered, loved, and
waited for the lost one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every story must have its sequel, so
has mine. I think it was five years before
it came.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a tiny cottage, embowered and
hidden by luxuriant vines and thick,
swaying foliage, in a quaint little town,
in a clime where the warmth and glory
and brightness of the midday sun is
never paled and dimmed by snow-hung
clouds, where the air is heavy
with the perfume of a thousand flowers,
and balmy with the luscious breath of
tropical fruits; where over the senses,
and into the soul, steal a dreamy, blissful
languor, and a strange, beautiful
peace, a woman in all her glorious
womanhood lay dying. And yet,
death does not seem very near to that
young creature who reclines on a low
couch by the open window, watching
and dreaming with a far away look in
the shadowy eyes, and a beautiful smile
upon the radiant face. A man with
blue eyes, full of woman’s tenderness,
and hair and beard of silvery whiteness,
is standing at her side. And now
the woman, turning her large, dark
eyes full upon him, speaks in a low,
musical voice that thrills the listener
with a subtile sense of pleasure and of
pain. “Dearest and best of friends, I
am come very near to the place where
the finite and the infinite meet, and
blend together, and are lost in one.
The past is vanishing like a glad dream,
so brief, and yet so full of joy and completeness.
All the unrest, and wild,
passionate longing seem very far away
from me now, such a strange, restful
life has come to me. I have been
thinking, perhaps it may be that some
lives gather their full measure of sunshine
and beauty in a very little time,
while others are longer upon the way.
And so, I have taken my happiness in
one delicious draught, and now hold
life’s empty goblet in my hands. I
have been waiting for this; my fate
was sealed when, a twelve-month ago,
they told me that my voice was irrecoverably
gone; for with it I had lost
my art, and that to me was simply life.
Well, it is best so. It may be in that
unknown beyond, whither I am hastening,
I shall find mine own again, and
my soul shall be satisfied. Today I
have been living again my old life, a
stranger and an alien, and yet tenderly
cared for by warm, loving hearts. I
suppose they mourned when they discovered
that their wild, willful March
had flown. The remembrance of the
pain I caused them has been my only
regret in this new life of mine—this
wonderful, grand life—and I owe it all
to you, my mother’s friend and mine.
After I am gone, you will send to my
dear foster-parents my good-bye message.
I have told them all. Of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>vain struggles to find my place among
the eager, restless throng in the great,
busy world, with only a wild, untrained
voice and an unconquerable will to aid
me. Of my finding a friend, the dearest
friend of my angel mother, who patiently,
lovingly bore with my capricious,
impetuous nature, and with
lavish prodigality helped me on toward
the wished for golden goal. And then
how destiny pressed close upon me,
with his black pinions o’ershadowing
me, and the fiat was—“Thus far shalt
thou go, and no farther.” Possibly
they may not understand it all. They
will think sadly that my life has been a
failure, and it may have been; still I
am glad to have lived it. It has been
grand, glorious, and yet I am a little
weary, and am impatient for the end.</p>

<p class='c005'>And very soon it came, and March
went from the storm, and the tempest,
the longing and the pain, into light ineffable,
and peace eternal.</p>

<p class='c005'>That old Roman, Sallust, says:
“Surely fortune rules all things. She
makes everything famous or obscure
rather from caprice than in conformity
with truth. The exploits of the Athenians,
as far as I can judge, were very
great and glorious, something inferior,
however, to what fame has represented
them. But because writers of great
talent flourished there, the actions of the
Athenians are celebrated over the world
as the most splendid achievements.
Thus the merit of those who have acted
is estimated at the highest point to
which illustrious intellects could exalt
it in their writings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Also, that latest of classical authors,
Josh Billings, says: “Young man, blow
your own horn!” These quotations
express exactly the way in which the
illustrious intellects of authors in Modern
Athens (of America) have exalted
the deeds of Massachusetts’ heroes to
such a degree that most people, outside
of New Hampshire, do not suppose
our state had much to do at the battle
of Bunker Hill, whereas New Hampshire
men constituted nearly four fifths
of all the men and officers in that battle.
Therefore I think I have just
cause to “blow my horn” for my native
town, and my ancestors who fought in
that battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Old Nottingham comprised a tract
of land supposed to be ten miles square,
and which is now Nottingham, Deerfield
and Northwood. It was incorporated
in 1722, and settlements
commenced in it soon after, at the
“Square,” a beautiful ridge of land
about 450 feet above the sea level. At
the beginning of the Revolution, Nottingham
had 999 inhabitants, Deerfield
929, and Northwood 313. The records
show that the people were making
preparations for the coming conflict,
and had sent generous assistance to
the “Industrious Poor sufferers of the
town of Boston” during the siege.
During the winter of 1774–5, Dr.
Henry Dearborn had a company of
men which met at the Square to drill
from time to time. In November, 1774,
a town-meeting was held and a committee
appointed to “Inspect into any
Person,” suspected of being a Tory.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the 20th of April, 1775, news
reached the Square that a battle
had been fought the day before, and
in the evening a large number of citizens
assembled at the store of Thomas
Bartlett. On the 21st, at 4 o’clock, a
company of nearly one hundred men
commenced their march for Boston,
being armed and equipped as best they
could at such short notice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some say that Joseph Cilley was the
leader of this band of heroes, but others
say Dr. Henry Dearborn was captain, and
probably he was, as he had been drill-master
all winter, and was captain of the
company after they arrived in Cambridge.
They marched on foot all night,
and arrived in Medford at eight o’clock
on the morning of the 22d, some of the
company having traveled, on foot, more
than eighty miles since the previous
noon, and over roads which were far
from being in the best condition for
rapid traveling.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have searched records a great deal
and inquired of the “oldest inhabitant,”
whenever I could find him, that I might
secure a complete list of the men who
constituted this company, but of the
hundred I can only give the following
names with certainty. If any reader of
this article can add a name he will do
me a great favor by forwarding it to me:</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Henry Dearborn, Joseph Cilley,
Jr., Thomas Bartlett, Henry Butler,
Zephaniah Butler, John Simpson, Nathaniel
Batchelder, Daniel Moore,
Peter Thurston, Maj. Andrew McClary,
Benjamin Johnson, Cutting Cilley,
Joseph Jackson, Andrew Neally, Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Johnson, Robert Morrison, William
Woolis, Eliphlet Taylor, William Blake,
Nathaniel Twombly, Simon Batchelder,
Abraham Batchelder, Simon Marston,
Moses Gilman, William Simpson, John
Nealey, and Samuel Sias. Let us
briefly glance at the record of some of
these men in the years that came after.</p>

<p class='c005'>Henry Dearborn was born in Hampton,
Feb. 23, 1751. He studied medicine
and settled at Nottingham Square as
a physician, in 1772. He married Mary
D. Bartlett, daughter of Israel, and
sister of Thomas Bartlett of Nottingham.
He was always fond of military
affairs, and is said to have been a skilful
drill-master and well posted in the
tactics in use previous to the Revolution.
He fought with his company at
the battle of Bunker Hill. In the
September following, he joined Arnold’s
expedition to Quebec, accompanied by
these Nottingham men,—James Beverly,
John P. Hilton, Samuel Sias and
Moses Gilman. They marched up the
Kenebec river, through the wilds of
Maine and Canada. In the assault
upon that city, Captain Dearborn
was taken prisoner. Peter Livias, the
Tory councilor at Quebec, influenced
the authorities to parole and send him
home, on condition that Dearborn
should forward his wife and children to
him from Portsmouth to Quebec, which
was done as agreed. In April, 1777,
Capt. Dearborn was appointed Major
in Scammel’s regiment. He was in the
battles of Stillwater and Saratoga and
fought with such bravery, having command
of a distinct corps, as to win the
special commendation of Gen. Gates.
In 1778, he was in the battle of Monmouth,
with Col. Cilley acting as Lieut.
Col., and helped retrieve Lee’s disgraceful
retreat. He was with Gen. Sullivan
in his expedition against the Indians, in
1779, and was at Yorktown at the surrender
of Cornwallis in 1781. Upon
the death of Scammel, the gallant Colonel
of the Third N. H. Reg., at the hands
of a barbarous foe, Dearborn was made
Colonel and held that position to the
end of the war. After the war, he settled
in Maine, where he was Marshal
by appointment of Washington. He
was two terms a member of Congress;
Sec’y of War under Jefferson from
1801 to 1809; collector of the port of
Boston between 1809–12; senior Maj.
General in U. S. Army, 1812–13,and
captured York in Canada, and Fort
George, at the mouth of Niagara. He
was recalled by the President, July 6,
1813, and put in command of the military
district of N. Y. City, which recall
was, no doubt, a great mistake. In
1822 he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary
to Portugal; recalled in
1824, at his own request: died at Roxbury,
Mass. June 6, 1829. General
Dearborn was a man of large size, gentlemanly
deportment, and one of the
bravest and most gallant men of his
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Joseph Cilley, son of Capt. Joseph
Cilley of Nottingham, was born in
1734; died 1799. He was engaged
in the attack upon Fort William and
Mary, in 1774; appointed Major in
Col. Poor’s regiment by the Assembly
of N. H. in 1775; he was not present
in the battle of Bunker Hill, as his regiment
was engaged in home defence.
He was made Lieut. Col. in 1776, and
April 2, 1777, was appointed Colonel
of the 1st. N. H. Reg. of three years’
men, in place of Col. Stark, resigned.
He fought his regiment bravely at Bemis’s
Heights, near Saratoga; and two
weeks later was among the bravest of
the brave, when Burgoyne made his
final attack before surrendering his entire
army of six thousand men. So
fierce was the battle, that a single cannon
was taken and retaken five times;
finally, Col. Cilley leaped upon it, waved
his sword, and “dedicating the gun
to the American cause,” opened it upon
the enemy with their own ammunition.
He was with Washington’s army
at Valley Forge, 1777–8; was at the
storming of Stony Point; at Monmouth
he was one of the heroes in retrieving
Gen. Lee’s retreat; was at the surrender
of Cornwallis at Yorktown, and in
other hard-fought battles of the Revolution.
After the war he was Major-General
of the 1st Div. N. H. militia,
and as such headed the troops which
quelled the insurrection at Exeter in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>1786, with his own hand arresting the
leader in the midst of his armed followers.
Gen. Cilley was a man of great
energy and industry, of strong passion,
yet generous and humane. He was
repeatedly elected representative, senator
and councillor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomas Bartlett was born Oct. 22,
1745; married Sarah, daughter of Gen.
Joseph Cilley; was town-clerk twenty-six
years; selectman thirty years; was
the first representative from Nottingham
to the General Court in 1784; was one
of the Committee of Safety which managed
the colonial affairs of New Hampshire
during part of the Revolution; was
captain of the 5th company of “six
weeks” men at Winter Hill in 1775;
was Lieut. Col. in Col. Gilman’s regiment,
in 1776; Lieut. Col. in Col.
Whipple’s regiment at Rhode Island,
in 1778; also was Lieut. Colonel under
Stark at the capture of Burgoyne.
In 1780 he was Colonel of a regiment
at West Point, when Arnold betrayed
that fort. In 1790 he was appointed
Justice of the Court of Common Pleas,
and retained that office till his death in
1805. He was Major-General of first
division of New Hampshire militia
from 1799 to 1805, in which office he
was preceded by Gen. Joseph Cilley,
and followed by Gen. Henry Butler.</p>

<p class='c005'>Henry Butler was a son of Rev. Benjamin
Butler, the first settled minister in
Nottingham, and was born April 27,
1754. He was captain of a company
in Col. Thomas Bartlett’s regiment at
West Point, in 1780. He held many
town and state offices; was the first
postmaster in Nottingham, when Gideon
Granger was Postmaster-General;
and was Major-General of the first division
of New Hampshire militia from
1805, for several years.</p>

<p class='c005'>Zephaniah Butler, brother to Rev.
Benjamin, was a school teacher in Nottingham
for many years preceding the
Revolution, and was one of Col. Cilley’s
staff officers during several campaigns.
He married a sister of Col. Cilley; Gen.
B. F. Butler, whom everybody knows,
is his grandson, he being son of Capt.
John Butler of Deerfield, who was son
of Zephaniah.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cutting Cilley, brother of Col. Joseph
Cilley, was born in 1738, and died
in 1825; he held many town offices,
and was captain of a company in one
of the New Hampshire regiments during
the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c005'>John Simpson, born in 1748, and dying
in 1810, is said to have been the man
who fired the first gun at the battle of
Bunker Hill. In 1778, he was lieutenant
in Capt. Simon Marston’s company,
Col. Peabody’s regiment; and was subsequently
promoted to major. His
brother, Robert, who also served in the
Revolutionary army, is the great grandfather
of General Ulysses Simpson
Grant.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nathaniel Batchelder, who was a
brother-in-law of Col. Cilley, fought
in the battle of Bunker Hill, under
Capt. Dearborn, and was adjutant in
Col. Drake’s regiment, which did brave
service in the battle of Stillwater, Saratoga,
and the surrender of Burgoyne.
He died of fever at Valley Forge,
March 28, 1778.</p>

<p class='c005'>Daniel Moore kept the first tavern at
Deerfield Parade; fought at Bunker
Hill and in subsequent battles; was
captain in Col. Stark’s regiment, and
did valiant service during the war.</p>

<p class='c005'>Andrew McClary was from Epsom
and belonged to a family distinguished
for its military men. He was plowing
in his field on the 20th of April, 1775,
when he <em>heard a horn blow</em>, which, on
the instant, he knew was the tocsin of
war; he left his plow in the furrow, and
after the speediest preparation, hastened
to Deerfield Parade and thence to Nottingham
Square, where he joined Capt.
Dearborn’s company. After they arrived
in Cambridge he was active in
helping organize the New Hampshire
men into companies and was himself
appointed major in Col. Stark’s regiment.
He fought with his regiment
at Bunker Hill, and was killed after the
battle, in attempting to have “another
shot at the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Robert Morrison was born and lived
on the Square; he was a member of
Dr. Dearborn’s company, which drilled
during the winter of 1774–5, and a
private in Capt. Dearborn’s company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in the battle of Bunker Hill. In the
September following he was bearer of
dispatches from Washington to the
Committee of Safety in New Hampshire,
by whom he was treated with distinguished
honors. In 1777 he was
a private in Col. Stark’s regiment, and
fought bravely in all the battles till the
surrender of Burgoyne. His son,
Robert Morrison, Esq., resides in Northwood
at the present time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Joseph Jackson was sergeant in Capt.
Dearborn’s company at Bunker Hill,
afterwards served in several campaigns
and was captain of a company.</p>

<p class='c005'>Samuel Johnson was not in the Bunker
Hill fight, but was in the campaign of
1777, at Bennington, Stillwater and
Saratoga, and took an active part under
a commission which gave him the rank
of colonel. He was one of the first
settlers of Northwood at the Narrows,
and was one of the selectmen of the
town for fifteen years.</p>

<p class='c005'>Simon Marston was from Deerfield,
having settled on the Longfellow farm
in 1763; he lived in the garrison house,
erected by Jonathan Longfellow. He
was sowing wheat when the courier,
shouting the news of the battle of Lexington,
rode past the field where he was
at work. Marston left the measure,
from which he was sowing, rushed to
the house, filled his knapsack with pork
and other necessaries, seized his gun,
and hurried down to the Square. He
acted in the capacity of an officer in
Col. Reed’s regiment at Bunker Hill;
was an officer under Lieut. Col. Senter;
was captain of 1st Co. Col. Peabody’s
regiment; was afterwards commissioned
major and fought at Bennington, Stillwater
and Saratoga. He was a brave
man in war and energetic in peace.
The others named, although they held
no office of rank, were no less brave
and faithful in performing perilous duties,
and deserve to have their names
recorded where they will never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the Nottingham men arrived in
Cambridge, and saw there was no danger
of another attack immediately by the
troops in Boston, several returned home
and commenced more thorough preparation
for the coming conflict, but Dr. Dearborn
and most of the men remained
and were organized into a company,
and Dearborn was elected captain the
company became a part of Col. Stark’s
regiment and was stationed at Medford,
whence they marched on the 17th of
June and participated in the glories
of “Breed’s Hill.” Captain Dearborn’s
company was No. 8, but he
marched from Medford to the “Railfence,”
by the side of Col. Stark.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following list of men comprising
this company is no doubt correct, as it
was furnished by Judge Nesmith for
Cogswell’s “History of Nottingham,
Deerfield and Northwood,” and the
Judge is one of the best authorities in
the State in such matters. The men
were nearly all from old Nottingham:</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><em>THE N. H. SEVENTH AT FT. WAGNER.</em></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div><span class='small'>[From sketch of Lieut. <span class='sc'>Henry W. Baker</span>, in Coffin’s History of Boscawen.]</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The command had been entrusted
to Gen. Trueman H. Seymour, who determined
to make an assault. He
knew nothing of the construction of
Ft. Wagner. No information of the
impediments to be overcome had
reached him. Col. Putnam of the 7th,
commanding the second brigade, opposed
the contemplated movement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not think that we can take the
fort,” he said; and when Gen. Seymour
reiterated his determination to
make the attempt, Col. Putnam said,
“We shall go like a flock of sheep.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The sun had set, and the twilight
faded. The soldiers were ordered to
remove the caps from the nipples of
their rifles, and were told that they
must depend upon the bayonet alone.
In the 100th N. Y., which formed behind
the 7th, this order was neglected.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the darkness the assaulting column
moved forward. The iron-clads,
and the Union batteries opened a heavy
fire, which was continued till the column
was so near that further firing
would endanger it, when, at a signal,
all the Union batteries became silent.
In an instant Ft. Wagner was aflame.
Its heavy siege guns, howitzers, and
forty-two pounder carronades burst
forth, pouring a stream of shot and
shell into the advancing troops. And
now, in addition, the parapet of the
fort swarmed with men, who, through
the terrible cannonade of the day had
been lying securely beneath the bomb
proofs. Mingled with the roar of the
cannon were their volleys of musketry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first brigade had the advance.
Its ranks went down like grass before
the mower. Some of the soldiers fled,
panic stricken. The second brigade,
led by the 7th N. H., pressed on and
filled the decimated ranks. Suddenly
they found themselves confronted by a
ditch fifty feet wide and ten feet deep,
with four feet of water flowing into it.
Only at the south-eastern angle was it
dry. It was enfiladed by howitzers. Into
the ditch leaped the soldiers. Grape
and canister mowed them down, but
others crowded on. The 7th N. H.,
led by Lt. Col. Joseph C. Abbott,
made its way unfalteringly into the
ditch, through it, and up the slope of
the parapet. Cannon and musketry
blazed in their faces; and now there
was a flash behind them—the 100th
N. Y., not having removed their caps,
were firing into the dark mass, not
knowing who was friend, who foe. All
was confusion. All order disappeared.
In the darkness no one could be recognized.
Amid the groans of the wounded,
the shouting of officers, the rattle
of rifles, the roar of cannon, the bursting
of shells, it was impossible to maintain
discipline. Col. Putnam, a few of
his subordinates, and one or two hundred
men entered the fort. The enemy
charged, but were driven back.
Col. Putnam was killed; one officer
after another went down. The reserve,
which should have rushed up, did not
come. The assault had lost its force.
Like sheep the Union soldiers fled as
best they could through the devastating
fire, leaving a ghastly heap of dead and
wounded in the ditch, and on the parapet
of the fort. Among the killed was
Henry W. Baker. By his side were
Dexter Pritchard, Liberty G. Raymond,
and Alexander F. Stevens, from
Boscawen, and of his company, also
killed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the wounded was Samuel
McEvely, and among the prisoners was
John Clancy, who died in prison at
Richmond.</p>

<p class='c005'>In his first battle, Lieut. Baker gave
his life to his country. Those who
served under him speak of him with affection.
He was cool and brave, and
ever mindful of his duty. He was
buried where he fell, with his commander,
Col. Putnam, and his subordinates,
Pritchard, Raymond, and Stevens.</p>

<p class='c005'>The events I am about to describe
took place at a critical period of “the
war to keep the Union whole,” and
cover that date in the career of the
army of the Potomac beginning with
Hooker’s flank movement against Lee,
entrenched on the heights of Fredericksburg,
and ending with the disastrous repulse
which attended that finely planned,
yet poorly executed, and ill-starred
campaign. Of course, I am not writing
history, except in a small way; nor
do I essay to describe in detail or with
accuracy the events in question. My
purpose is to give my own observations
and experiences, mainly from memory,
reinforced by a few scraps and half-illegible
memoranda saved from the accidents
by flood and field.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was a participant in many of the
earlier battles fought by the army of
the Potomac; but my opportunities
for acquiring accurate information
touching the general aspects of the
field were necessarily limited to that
part of it within my own immediate
range of vision, and even here—so rigidly
did our commanders aim to reduce
us to mere automatons—we were often
in the dark as to the meaning of this or
that movement. I strove hard to master
the situation, but not until the war
closed and the reports of commanders
were given to the public, did I have
other than a very indefinite conception
of much that transpired about me.
Why we made this or that change of
front; why we were kept for hours in
line of battle beneath a broiling sun
with no enemy in sight; why we were
rushed from one point to another in an
apparently hap-hazard manner, enduring
fatigue and hunger and subsisting
upon wormy “hardtack;” why we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>pushed against impregnable positions,
when a flank movement seemed to our
inexperienced eyes the proper thing to
do—now fighting, now building corduroy
roads, digging rifle-pits or supporting
batteries in our rear, which did
more execution upon us, by reason of
defective ammunition, than upon the enemy—concerning
all these points, and
many more we were anxious to be informed,
but not one atom of information
could we get.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Was this reticence in pursuance of the
mistaken theory that machine soldiers
are best? Or was it because “some one
had blundered,” and ignorance or incapacity,
or something still worse, could
be the more easily concealed? Whatever
the reason, the fact remains that
to the rank and file much of the campaigning
done up to 1863–64 seemed
to them worse than needless;—and
looking back over that period with the
light of history thrown upon it, I am
not prepared to say the rank and file
were mistaken in their estimate. I
was impressed then, and the impression
has never been effaced, that the
reticence observed toward the men in
the ranks touching what was going on
about them, was a grievous error on
the part of our commanders. It is a
question, certainly, whether it would
not have been better to have kept the
“boys” informed of the real military
situation and of what they were expected
to achieve. The belief that much
of the hardship endured was the result
of blundering generals, or, worse, of
criminal indifference, did much to unman
our soldiers and cause them to lose
faith and hope. Our volunteers were not
machine soldiers, as some of the West
Pointers seemed to presume, but patriotic,
thinking and observing men who
could fight best when they fought understandingly.
I am told that the
rebel commanders pursued a different
policy, and although their soldiers were
mentally inferior to ours, kept them
apprized of the general situation and
of what they must do to accomplish the
end sought. Who shall say how many
of the confederate victories may be accredited
to this fact, if it is a fact? But
our commanders, instead of trusting
their men, either kept them in utter ignorance
of movements or foolishly deceived
them. How well I remember
at the battle of Gaines’s Hill, where
Jackson thrashed Porter so soundly,
and Sykes’s regulars failed to stand their
ground, that the story was industriously
circulated along the thinned but unbroken
ranks of Bartlett’s Brigade, “McClellan’s
in Richmond, boys. One more
effort and the day is ours!” And Meagher’s
Irish Brigade, hastening to our
relief on the run, took up the cry and
put on so determined a front that Jackson’s
veterans halted and reformed,
giving our officers time to re-establish
their broken lines and hold their
ground until night came down and afforded
them an opportunity to withdraw
to the left bank of the Chickahominy,—not
to enter Richmond, but
to begin that celebrated “flank movement”
which ended at Harrison’s
Landing. Again, at second Bull Run,
when, after dawdling along all day on
the road from Alexandria to Centreville,
with the sounds of conflict in our
front (making a long two hours’ rest at
Annandale, and then marching at full
speed in a hot sun), we reached Centreville,
we were told that Pope had
whipped Jackson, and that Lee with
his whole army was in full retreat. But
when we reached Bull Run, “Linden
saw another sight.” Heavens, what a
stampede! McDowell’s and Sigel’s
corps in disastrous retreat,—cavalry, artillery,
infantry, ammunition and baggage
wagons in one confused, struggling
mass, intent upon reaching the
heights of Centreville. Our corps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>(Franklin’s, 6th) had just halted to rest,
as the stragglers came into view. Deploying,
we stopped the rout, and ended
the retreat. Seizing the infantry
stragglers, we placed them in our own
ranks until our brigade swelled to twice
its usual size. Night closed in, and we
were marched to the front across Cub
Run, and ordered to hold our position
at all hazards. In that march every
straggler deserted! Poor fellows, who
could blame them? Had they been
killed then and there who could have
accounted for them? Most of them returned
to their own regiments and thereafter
did good service no doubt. Panics
are liable to seize upon the best of
troops. I cite these instances as partial
corroboration of my point. What
wonder if our troops came to distrust
all reports and to depend only upon
established facts. But perhaps our
commanders were right in concealing
information from the army in general,
and Moore may have hit the nail on the
head when he wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A captain has been known to think,</div>

      <div class='line'>Nine cases out of ten—of treason.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At any rate they conducted the war
in harmony with such a belief.</p>

<p class='c005'>One battle only did I witness from
the vantage ground of a non-combatant,
the first Fredericksburg fight, and
I found it vastly more interesting and
conducive to personal ease and safety,
if less glorious. But this is not what I
started out to tell the readers of this
Magazine. I am to relate my experience
during that memorable episode referred
to in my opening paragraph. I must
say at the outset that it was an exceedingly
checkered episode, so far as my
memory serves me, for within the time
outlined I ran the gamut of a soldier’s
emotions—anxiety, uncertainty, fear,
hope, the thrill of victory succeeded all
too quickly by the blackest despair;
for success was followed by repulse,
and from an elated victor I became almost
in a twinkling, a captive in the
hands of as ragged and as dirty a lot of
Johnny Rebs as ever fought with a
courage worthy of a better cause,—a
part of Wilcox’s Alabama brigade,
McLaw’s division. But I must not anticipate.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the winter of 1862–63, our
brigade lay encamped near White Oak
church, a locality about equi-distant, if
my memory serves me, between Falmouth
on the Rappahannock and
Belle Plain on the Potomac. It had
had ample time to recuperate from the
fatigue of the “mud march,” as Burnside’s
second futile attempt to dislodge
Lee from his entrenchments about
Fredericksburg, was facetiously termed,
and as spring opened the routine of
life in cantonment was relieved by parades,
reviews, inspections, drills, and,
occasionally, target practice. Meantime
Hooker had superceded Burnside
in chief command, and a new and
more vigorous life had been infused into
all branches of the service. This
was particularly true of the cavalry,
which had fallen into general disfavor.
Under Hooker’s discipline it became
very effective. The high-sounding
grand divisions had been broken up,
and the over-cautious, phlegmatic
Franklin, relieved. With other changes,
came Sedgwick to the command of our
corps—a great improvement in some
respects on Franklin. The cool and
sagacious Slocum, so long at the head
of the red-cross division, had been promoted
to the command of a corps, and
Gen. Brooks, as brave, perhaps, but a
far less skilful soldier, had succeeded
him, having been promoted from the
Vermont brigade. Gen. Joe Bartlett
of New York, commanded our brigade—a
fine officer, and a lion in battle. A
brave man, too, was our Colonel, but
deficient in tactical skill. He might
not “set a squadron in the field,” but
he could face the enemy’s line of battle
without flinching. In action he was
the embodiment of pluck, and at such
times he looked as if he might be the

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>“——Colonel</div>

<p class='c009'>in continental days. But he did not
appear to advantage on parade, being
undersized and awkward gaited, with a
shrill, piercing voice, not unlike that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the late Isaac O. Barnes, or the irrepressible
Mel. Weston, and totally indifferent
to all the niceties of drill so
pleasing to the holiday soldier. On
one occasion he forgot his place at a
Brigade dress parade, and was then
and there rebuked sharply by the general.
Meeting the latter at headquarters
the same evening, where a “reception”
to the officers of the brigade was
in full career and good fellowship, aided
by copious draughts of “commissary,”
abounded, the Colonel extended
his hand and piped out in a high key
which attracted the attention of all
present: “Gineral, I’m not much at
drill I confess, but I’ve got a hell-fired
stomach for a fight!”</p>

<p class='c005'>On the morning of the 28th of April,
1863, our regiment was ordered on
picket duty, but scarcely had we relieved
the old picket guard when orders
came to return to camp, strike
tents, and prepare to move at once in
heavy marching order. This meant
work, but was an agreeable change. I
had only joined my regiment the day
previous, after a brief leave of absence,
and was resplendent in a new uniform,
sword, etc. Of course I packed the
uniform away, and left it in care of the
sutler, while I donned a knit blouse,
and with a due regard for sharpshooters
of which the Confederacy had, as it
always seemed to me when on the
skirmish line, more than its share, put
myself in condition for serious work,
having nothing in the way of wearing
apparel save my side-arms to indicate
military rank. Meantime a great
change had been effected in our winter
quarters. The tents had been removed
from the log huts to which they had
served as roofs and windows, and now
the bare interiors, with the debris
strewn about, and broken chimneys and
blackened walls alone remained. A
more dismal or melancholy sight than a
deserted cantonment cannot be conceived.
“Warm work ahead, boys,”
gaily and cheerily remarked our jovial,
stout-hearted adjutant, as he rode up
to the head of the regiment. It proved
to be particularly hot for him, for he
received a wound in his head, in the
charge on Marye’s Heights, that he
will carry to his grave, and which ended
his military career, but not his usefulness;
for he is now a popular clergyman,
a true soldier of the cross, settled
in Philadelphia, I believe. Our
progress was slow, and darkness intervened
just as we reached a ravine leading
down to the narrow valley which
skirts the river on that side. We bivouacked
in our tracks, not being allowed
to kindle fires. Back over the
route we had come could be heard the
rumble of artillery wagons and the
tramp, tramp, of marching columns.
In front, silence reigned. Orders are
issued in a low tone; and that stern
composure which soldiers assume when
about to encounter the enemy was
apparent in the bearing of all. The
officers gather around their adjutant,
who is a favorite at brigade and division
headquarters, to learn his views
touching the movement. He thinks
we are in for a fight, and gives his opinion
as to Hooker’s intentions. He is
sanguine of success.—We have hardly
closed our eyes in sleep, when some
one calls out in a voice seemingly loud
enough for the rebel pickets to hear,
“Where is Colonel Blank?” “Here,
sir,” responds that officer, rubbing his
eyes. “What’s wanted?” “Gen. B.
directs me to say that you are to
march your regiment to the bank of the
river, form in line of battle, and await
further orders. You are to move expeditiously,
with as little noise as possible,
following the pontoons.” The order
is obeyed; the regiment marching
away in almost spectral silence. Debouching
from the ravine, the darkness
deepens, for a dense fog hangs over the
valley of the Rappahannock like a
pall. We file past the pontoon train,
from which the engineer corps are detaching
the boats, silently and with
all the celerity possible—and stand upon
the river’s brink. In our rear come
other regiments, until our whole brigade
is closed in line five regiments deep.—It
was a critical time. I recall it well.
The silence was almost oppressive; orders
were given in low tones, and nothing
but the rattle of accoutrements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>broke the silence. The fog resembled
a mirage. Objects a little way off took
on gigantic proportions. I remember
that a pontoon boat, borne on stout
shoulders to the river’s brink, resembled
the immense hulk of a ship as it
loomed into view, while at the distance
of a few feet men took on colossal dimensions.
Meantime we are tolled off
in detachments to occupy the pontoons,
along with the engineers who
are to do the navigation, and our orders
are to form instantly on reaching
the other shore, dash forward and capture
the enemy’s picket line, or whatever
force may be there to oppose us.
At length there are sounds of commotion
on the other side. The Johnnies
suspect something. Splash! goes a
pontoon into the water, followed by a
deep curse from the officer in charge,
brave old Gen. Benham, who cannot
restrain his rage over the carelessness
of his men. Meanwhile the fog has been
gradually rising, and the gray of dawn
appears. More stir on the other side, a
rattling of equipments, hurried commands—then
a sharp challenge, (some
of our scouts are nearly over), followed
by a single musket discharge, then a volley,
and the whistle of bullets. Instinctively
we do them low obeisance; the
lines waver for an instant, then firmness
and silence. So heavy a fire was
not anticipated. It told of a large reserve
which must have been brought up
in expectation of an attack. All hope
of a surprise was over. “Will the pontoons
never be launched?” Yes, Benham
has done his duty, and into them
we scramble and push off, each boat for
itself. The stream is narrow at this
point, but we are not swift enough to
check another volley, which being better
directed than the first, killed and
wounded a number of our boys in the
boats. Almost at the same instant our
pontoon touches the shore. There is a
rush, a charge, a brief struggle, and that
picket guard is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors du combat</span></i>. Quickly
deploying on the bank we advance,
but the enemy retires more quickly;—and
we have established a firm foothold,
the pontoon bridge is laid, and
the whole corps is streaming across as
the morning sun rises above the horizon.
The fog still clings, however, to
the rising ground on which Franklin
fought at the first battle of Fredericksburg,
and we move with due caution,
skirmishers well out, not knowing what
sort of a reception Stonewall Jackson,
whose corps is known to occupy the
wooded heights beyond, may have in
store for us. But no serious opposition
is offered after the affair of the pickets,
and gradually we occupy most of the
ground previously held by the centre of
Franklin’s grand division. The fog
lifts at last, and the sight revealed is a
picturesque one. Before us, a level
plain, extending on the right to the suburbs
of Fredericksburg, and on the
left, cut with ravines and hillocks somewhat,
for a long distance. Back of us,
the river; fronting, on either hand, the
plain ending in a range of wooded hills,
semicircular in shape, and dotted with
fortifications. The enemy’s picket line
is well out upon the plain but touching
the river above us near the city. Extending
our left it soon came in contact
with Reynolds’ corps, which had
effected a crossing a mile or two lower
down, after a sharp artillery fight in
which the enemy showed superior metal,
but was obliged to retire after the
infantry got over. Midway from the
river to the range of hills, and parallel
with the former, is a deep ravine where
partial shelter from the concentric fire
from the artillery posted on Marye’s
Heights on the right and on the hills
in front, was afforded Franklin’s troops
in the previous battle. A few artillery
shots are fired, soon after establishing
our lines, and then all becomes quiet.
What does this inaction portend? Evidently,
Lee is acting on the defensive,
and waiting for the development of
Hooker’s strategy. He does not have
long to wait. Before us is the whole
rebel army. Will it swoop down upon
us before Hooker can develop his left
and crush us? This is the conundrum
with which we wrestle, as the hours wear
away, varying it with a conjecture as to
whether we shall be ordered to assault
the enemy, in his chosen position,
against which Burnside had thrown the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>flower of his army only to be hurled
back discomfited. Another artillery
duel between Reynolds and Jackson
later in the day closes the fighting, and
a night of repose follows. The succeeding
day proved to be one of quiet,
also, but there was a constant movement
of troops in our rear on the
heights of Falmouth, the line of march
being directly up river.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You see them on their winding way,</div>
      <div class='line'>About their ranks the sunbeams play.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>That night our regiment went on picket.
Never shall I forget it. Strict orders
had been received, prohibiting fires, or
conversation above a whisper, and requiring
the most vigilant watchfulness to prevent
surprise, as the enemy in heavy force
was directly in our front. Our eyes
were kept constantly on the rebel sentinels
moving ghost-like upon their
beats.  A dense fog settled down, cold
and damp. The hours seemed leaden.
The suspense became intense, unbearable.
Suddenly a tremor sweeps along
the line. Our boys are doubly alert.
What does it mean? A message comes
down the front line—“The enemy are
advancing. Hold your ground until
the reserves are formed, then rally upon
them!” With muskets firmly grasped
the Union pickets await the onset.
A night attack is always dreaded by
soldiers, and nothing is more trying to
the nerves of veterans than the expectation
of a conflict with an unseen foe.
But our boys do not flinch; they feel
the responsibility imposed upon them
and resolve to do their duty. Minutes
go by, and still no advance, although
the weird line of sentinels has been succeeded
by a line of battle. Momentarily
we expect to see a sheet of flame
burst from that compact mass, the components
of which are indistinguishable
in the fog and darkness, although hardly
six rods distant. But it comes not.
The mass recedes and fades out, leaving
the sentinels pacing their posts, and
we now know that the movement was
only a reconnaissance. Morning dawns
at length, and we are relieved without
firing a shot. As we gain the shelter of
the ravine near the bank of the river,
we notice that Reynolds has recrossed
with his whole corps and is marching in
the direction taken by the main army.
Looking toward the rebel position on
our left, dark masses of men are seen
moving over the hills, as if in retreat.
Here again we have food for speculation.
Has Hooker, whose guns are
now heard on the right, outflanked the
enemy? Later on we learned that these
troops were Stonewall Jackson’s rear
guard, that intrepid commander being
then in the process of executing that famous
flank movement which put the
11th corps to rout and turned a Union
success into a Confederate victory, the
most signal ever achieved by its armies.
About noon our troops made a demonstration,
driving back the enemy’s pickets,
and later in the day rifle-pits were
dug under cover of army blankets hung
up as if to dry—a device so simple as to
deceive the Confederates, for otherwise,
being commanded by their guns, it
could not have been effected without
serious loss.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day (Saturday, May 2),
was comparatively quiet, although far
to the right could be heard the deep,
yet muffled sound of artillery firing,
telling that Hooker was engaged. We
made demonstrations all along our
front, but did no real fighting. During
the night, the firing on the right became
very heavy,—and I was called into line
at about 2 a. m., to go through ere another
chance to sleep was afforded me,
the most exciting experiences of my
life. We were marched to the front,
and posted in a ravine. With the first
streaks of dawn came sounds of musketry
firing on our right. It was the
Light Division in the streets of Fredericksburg.
Marching by the left flank
we emerge from the ravine and take a
position on the left, the second, and
third and light divisions of our corps
extending to the right. As we leave
the ravine the enemy opens a heavy
fire upon our devoted regiment, the
hills on our front and right being aflame
with the flashes of the “red artillery.”
We advance rapidly, our general leading;
our batteries gallop to the rising
ground, and open on the enemy’s guns
posted near the railroad embankment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and which are doing the most execution.
Our guns are splendidly served, and
soon the rebel battery in front and its
infantry supports are seen making quick
time for the fortifications in the woods
at the base of the hill. Now the guns on
the hills redouble their fire, and the din is
terrible. Men are falling at every step,
and so fierce is the concentric artillery
fire of the Confederates that our batteries
have to be withdrawn. Not so the infantry.
It is our part to keep the
rebel force in front employed while
the divisions on our right storm
Marye’s Heights. So we keep steadily
on until a ravine is reached running at
right angles with the one we have left,
and leading nearly up to the rebel entrenchments.
The air is full of screaming
shot and whistling shell, and as we
near the entrance to the ravine, which
is filled with a thick undergrowth of
trees and bushes, our boys are ready
to insist that at least five hundred rebel
cannon have the range and are peppering
us accordingly. Through the hell
of fire we go, marching by the left flank
and closing up our ranks with each
breach, and into the ravine from which
the enemy’s sharpshooters are seen to
scamper like so many rats, as much to
escape the range of their own cannon as
that of our musketry, for we had not as
yet fired a shot.—Here, by hugging the
steep sides, we were partially sheltered
and within half rifle practice of the foe
posted behind their breastworks at the
base of the hill. A brisk fusilade was
kept up, and although we were unsupported
and “in the air” we kept the
Johnnies so busy that they did not attempt
a sortie. By this time, also, the
batteries on Marye’s Heights, which had
enfiladed us, had as much as they could
do nearer home, for Howe and Newton
had begun their advance. It being
deemed useless to attempt to do more
than keep the enemy in our front employed,
our regiment was withdrawn
from the ravine and the Parrotts were
again opened on the position, which we
had, supposed was to be stormed.—“The
war which for a space did fail,”
now opens furiously on our right, and
we watch the advance of the light division
with interest, although our regiment
is still exposed to a galling fire
from riflemen behind the railroad
embankment.—The spectacle was
a thrilling one. The 6th corps batteries
were playing upon the heights,
with might and main, and up the
steep ascent our brave boys were
climbing with all speed. Our hearts
were in our throats as we watched.
Could the heights be stormed? Could
Sedgwick with 10,000 men do what
Burnside failed to do with ten times
that number? Our Colonel, who has
been watching the conflict through his
field-glass, electrifies us at last by exclaiming,
“The heights are ours, boys!”
“Our flag is there!” Such a cheer as
went up must have astonished our
friends just opposite. A rebel brigade,
which had left the entrenchments near
our front and was making all speed to
succor its friends, suddenly halted,
then taking in the situation turned
about and ran back again, its pace being
accelerated by shots from cannon
just taken. The victory was ours thus
far, but at what a cost! It was a brief
triumph, alas! for disaster had overtaken
Hooker, and he was a beaten general
at that moment. We knew it not, however.
Contrariwise it was announced
that Hooker had been even more successful,
and that Lee’s routed army was in
rapid retreat on Richmond. Joy filled
our hearts, even though we mourned the
death of many brave comrades whose
last roll call on earth had been answered
that morning. Hence, when orders
came for our brigade to fall in and take
the lead in the pursuit on our side, they
were obeyed with alacrity, and up and
over the battle-stained heights we
marched, munching our hardtack as we
went, and out upon the Chancellorsville
pike, driving the enemy before us like
chaff before the wind. Two miles out,
a battery opened upon us, but we took
little notice, pushing our skirmish line
rapidly forward. It was a fatal discharge,
however, to an officer on
Brooks’ staff, who fell from his horse,
nearly decapitated by a shell.—One of
our batteries is hurried to the front and a
single discharge causes the enemy to retire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>on the double quick. We reach Salem
church, nearly exhausted by our rapid
marching, hoping for rest. But the
worst is yet to come. Our skirmish
line is held at bay. It cannot advance,
and our brigade is formed for a charge—my
own regiment, through the negligence
of some one, going into the fight
in heavy marching order, with knapsacks
strung, and blankets strapped.
Meeting a heavy fire of musketry
at the edge of a piece of
woods, the brigade halts. But Gen.
Brooks, who has orders to effect a
junction with Hooker, and deeming
the enemy in front to be the same we
have been driving, orders another advance.
Into the woods we go to be
met by a terrific fire. We charge and
drive the foe from his breastworks, but
can go no further. Heavily reinforced
he advances with yells. There is a
continuous roll of musketry. The
Pennsylvania regiments on our right
and left give ground. We are outflanked
and enfiladed. Then comes
the order to fall back. It must be done
quickly if we would not be entirely cut
off from the second line. Burdened as
many of our men are by their knapsacks,
and fatigued by the march, they
can not run. Such is my condition.
Although with only a blanket to
carry, I am quite used up physically.
The double-quick is beyond my powers,
and with every disposition in the world
to run I cannot to save my life. Suddenly,
one leg refuses to move, and I
fall. A call to my men is unheard, or
if heard, unheeded. I try to regain my
feet, but cannot. My leg seems paralyzed.
Am I hit? wounded? A brother
officer sees me; hears my call for assistance;
and proffers aid; helps me to
my feet, and I stagger along for a few
paces. Meantime, we have been left
far in the rear and are between two
fires. The air is laden with missiles. It
is madness to proceed, and so we both
hug the ground. Doubtless our lives
are saved by this device, but, although
we had not the faintest idea then that
such was the case, it involved our capture
and imprisonment. “The combat
deepens.” The din is awful. Line
after line of Lee’s veterans surges forward;
they intermingle; halt, yell, fire;
then rush on like a mob. It is not until
they have fairly run over us that we
realize our position—that capture is inevitable.
Two lines pass us unnoticed,
when a squad of skirmishers who have
hung on our flank come up and demand
our surrender. There is no alternative,
and that brand-new blade
goes into the hands of a rebel sergeant
whose straight, black hair runs up
through a rent in his hat like a plume.
We are taken to the rear amid a rain of
shot from our batteries, three men
helping me along and two keeping close
guard over my companion. They
seemed in a hurry to get out of range,
and glad of the opportunity our capture
afforded them of retiring with eclat from
the strife. Soon we came upon Gen.
Wilcox and staff nicely ensconced in a
position not accessible to Yankee bullets.
He questioned us, but not getting
satisfactory replies, sent us still further
to the rear (after his Adjutant-General
had purchased my sword of the hatless
sergeant), where we were placed under
guard near a field hospital. Here I
found, upon examination, that I was
not injured, but that my inability to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>walk without help was due to fatigue
and a slight abrasion on the hip, occasioned
probably by a spent ball. We
were courteously treated by our guards
but could get no food, Stoneman’s raid
having sadly interfered with the rebel
commissariat. Next day we were taken
to Spottsylvania court-house where we
met nearly half of the 11th corps and
learned for the first time the disaster
that had befallen “Fighting Joe”
Hooker. Of the kindness of one of
my captors, Billy Peyton of Memphis,
Tenn., but a member of the
9th Alabama, and his peculiarities, I
should like to speak, but this sketch has
grown on my hands, and I am compelled
to omit an account of my first
visit to Richmond, introduction to Major
Turner, and incarceration in Libby.
Should this sketch please the readers of
this Magazine, I may essay another describing
my prison life, and how near I
came to being annihilated by a fierce
Virginia home guard officer who commanded
the escort which conducted
the detachment of prisoners, of which
I made one, to the flag of truce boat
on the James, going by the way of
Petersburgh.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>RELIGIOUS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>At first, worship, both private and
public, was conducted in the primative
homes of the settlers of the township.
On the erection of military posts, or
forts, such edifices became natural, social
centres, and worship was conducted
in one or more of them. Rev.
James Scales, first minister of the town,
was ordained in Putney’s Fort, in 1757.
During the ministry of Mr. Scales, public
worship was sometimes conducted
at the Parsonage. The erection of a
church determined a permanent place
of public religious services.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first meeting-house in Hopkinton
represented a much larger territorial expanse
of population than any church
now extant. Denominational controversies
had not divided the ranks of the
worshipers, nor had local patrons of the
one church demanded special privileges
of their own. The distance to
church was long in many cases, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the conveyances often only the locomotory
means of nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>In olden times in this vicinity, though
people had the instinct of personal
adornment the same as now, they often
lacked the means of gratifying it. Extra
articles of dress were so rare that people
frequently walked to church in their
daily accustomed garb, or trod the
Sunday path with a most scrupulous
care for their extra wardrobe. Women
sometimes carried the skirts of their
Sunday dresses on their arms till they
arrived near or at the church door,
when they let them fall. The Sunday
shoes were often carried in the hand
till the journey to meeting was nearly
ended, when they were put on for entrance
to the sanctuary. Present readers
can comprehend the necessity of
such care, when they reflect that in the
olden time the price of a week’s work
of a woman was only equivalent to a
yard of cloth, or a pair of shoes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Church services in the former days
were long, and savored of dogmatic theology.
The principal prayer was much
longer than the present average sermon,
and the discourse proportionally
extended. Such prolonged services
were conducted in winter, at first, without
the favor of any artificial warmth.
In contemplating the situation of the
worshipers in those old wintry days, the
bleakness of the characteristic meeting-house
of the times is to be taken into
account. In the old Baptist church
was an open aperture in an upper wall,
where the crows have been known to
perch while worship was in progress.
The advent of foot-stoves gave much
relief to the chilly congregations of
earlier times, and the introduction of
the general heater put an end to the
extremer experiences of the wintry
Sunday.</p>

<p class='c005'>The representative minister of the
olden time was a person of eminent
scholarly culture and gentlemanly bearing.
A thorough scholar and rhetorician,
his discourses were framed with
strict regard to the logical sequences of
his subject. The numerical divisions
of his theme often carried him among
units of the second order; firstly, secondly,
and thirdly were only preliminary
to thirteenthly, fourteenthly, and fifteenthly;
the grand category of predications
was terminated by a “conclusion.”
In his loftier intellectual
schemes, he sometimes elaborated
whole volumes of disquisitional matter.
Rev. Ethan Smith, third minister in the
town, was the author of several profound
theological treatises. There was a dignity
and austerity of manner pertaining
to the characteristic primative clergyman
that made him a pattern of personified
seriousness. His grave demeanor
on his parochial rounds, when
he spoke directly upon the obligations
of personal religion, made his presence
in the household a suggestion of profound
respect and awe. He impressed
his personality upon the receptive social
element of his parish. The deacons
became only minor pastors, and
the whole congregation of believers expressed
in subdued form the character
of the shepherd of the flock.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The austere influence of religion upon
society in the olden time was attested by
the legal strictures upon traveling,
idling, etc., on Sunday, of which conduct
the tything-men were to take cognizance.
Tything-men were chosen in this town as
late as 1843, when Charles Barton, Samuel
Frazier and Daniel Chase were selected.
The law requiring such choice had
even then become virtually a dead letter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The support of a “learned and orthodox
minister” was implied in the
original grant of this township. In the
strict construction of the text of the
original compact, “orthodoxy” meant
Calvinistic Congregationalism. The
disturbed condition of the early settlement
prevented the establishment of a
permanent local pastorate till 1757.
On the 8th of September of that year,
it was voted to settle the Rev. James
Scales, and that he should be ordained
on the 23d of the following November.
His salary was to be sixty Spanish
milled dollars, or their equivalent in
paper bills, a year. When the town
became incorporated in 1765, the formal
acknowledgment of Mr. Scales as legal
pastor was renewed, it being the 4th of
March, and his salary was named at
£13, 10s.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>In progress of time different religious
societies became established in this
town, but the Congregational alone
drew support from any portion of the
populace by a direct tax. People were
taxed for the support of the Congregational
ministry in this town as late as
1810. The warrant for a town-meeting
called for the 12th of March, 1811,
contained this article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c005'>“To see what method the town will
take to raise money for the support of
the Congregational minister in town the
ensuing year, how levied, and how divided
between the two meeting-houses.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c005'>At this time a meeting-house had
been, for about ten years, in existence at
Campbell’s Corner, in the westerly part
of the town, and since its erection the
funds for the support of Congregational
preaching derived from taxes had been
divided between the east and west
meeting-houses, as they were called.
However, at the town-meeting called
for the above date, it was voted to
“pass over the article” relating to the
proposed support of Congregational
religious services by the town, and we
think the subject was never taken up
again.</p>

<p class='c005'>The minister’s tax was never collected
of any person who acknowledged a
belief in the religious principles of any
legalized society, other than the Congregational.
The following vote,
passed on the 25th of March, 1799, illustrated
the method of raising the minister’s
tax:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c005'>“Voted to lay a ministerial tax on
the Congregational inhabitants at twenty
cents each on the poll, and upon all
ratable estate in the same proportion,
Congregational inhabitants to be ascertained
by consent, individually, to either
of the selectmen at the time of taking
the inventory.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c005'>People liable to pay a minister’s tax
sometimes publicly, in town-meeting,
declared their adhesion to the principles
of some one or other of the societies
exempted from the payment of that
tax.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lease of the parsonage lands in
1798, incurred an annual revenue which
was proportionately divided among the
existing societies till the year 1853. In
the year 1842, when the town for the
first time published a printed report of
its pecuniary transactions, the last division
of parsonage money was declared
to be as follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>

    <td class='c007'>Methodist society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>1.43</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c005'>The round total was set down at $88.00.</p>

<p class='c005'>The 2d Congregational society
dropped out of the list in 1851. The
last allowance to this society was fifty-six
cents. The town report of the year
1853, contained the following and last
list of apportionments of parsonage
money:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>Congregational society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>$30.09</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>Union Baptist society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>19.04</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>Calvinist Baptist society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>15.72</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>Episcopalian society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>4.40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>1st Universalist society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>7.57</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>2d Universalist society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>7.10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>Methodist society,</td>
    <td class='c013'>4.18</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c005'>The total of this list was also set down
in round numbers as $88.</p>

<p class='c005'>The above figures are suggestive in
presenting a view of the relative
strength of the different societies at the
specific times stated. It is interesting
to note that certain of the societies
soon lost all traces of even a nominal
existence, after the suspension of the
parsonage revenues. For some time
they had kept up a show of vitality by
making their portion of the parsonage
fund a nucleus of an outlay for a few
days’ preaching in the year.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the march of the years, the old peculiarities
of local religious life have
given place to new features and forms.
It is needless to say that some of the
old formalities died hard. Innovations
were distrusted. The experience in
view of proposed changes was substantially
uniform in all the churches. Even
the staid Episcopalians were ruffled by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>unaccustomed ceremonies. When, for
the first time, the choir of the Episcopal
church chanted the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria Patri</span></cite>,
which before had been read only, an indignant
lady abruptly shut her prayer
book in unfeigned disgust. The greater
jealousy formerly existing between
different denominations is well known.
It is said this inharmonious feeling was
once sought to serve an innovating use.
A person prominent in musical circles
sought to influence the leading minds
of the Congregational church in favor
of the purchase of a bass viol. As an
extreme argumentative resort he suggested,
“The poor, miserable Baptists
have got one.” Tradition, however,
doesn’t relate the effect of this suggestion.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>COMMERCIAL.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The country store of the earliest
times was a more emphatic collection
of multitudinous varieties of articles, if
possible, than the later place of local
public traffic. Then, as now, the local
store was the principal resort of the
great commonalty. Men of special vocations
sometimes took a stock of products
to the lower country and bartered
for goods to bring back and distribute
among their neighbors, and the itinerant
merchant, or pedlar, reaped a much
better harvest than now; but the
country store was a popular necessity
and well patronized. At first there was
less trading in domestic luxuries; the
goods in store represented the common
necessities. Since the popular idea of
necessity does not fully exclude the illusory
principle, we have to admit rum,
gin, brandy, etc., into the former list of
domestic staples. Cash and barter
were entertained by every tradesman,
to whom the populace largely looked
for advantageous exchanges of substance.
The progress of the settlement
was attended by the extension, and to
some extent by the classification, of
trade till the time when Hopkinton assumed
the commercial importance described
in a previous article.</p>

<p class='c005'>The currency employed in the transaction
of business was at first nominally
English, though Spanish milled dollars
were in circulation. One of the inconveniences
of the early settlers of New
England was a scarcity of money. The
different provincial governments sought
to relieve the public financial burdens
by the issue of Bills of Credit, a currency
mentioned in the records of this
town as “old tenor.” Such a circulating
medium in such a time could only depreciate
in value, but, following a custom
obtaining in the old country, the
purchasing value of these bills could
from time to time be fixed by the local
legislatures. About the year 1750, it
was established throughout the provinces
that £1 in the currency of the Bills of
Credit should be equivalent to two shillings
and eight pence lawful money, and
that six shillings should be equal to one
dollar.</p>

<p class='c005'>The preliminary events of the Revolution
involved the establishment of a
system of Continental currency. At the
time of the first issue of a paper circulating
medium, in 1775, the Continental
notes were nearly at par with gold, but
they soon fell to comparative nothingness
in value. The effect of this collapse
in monetary matters was amply
illustrated in the public transactions of
the town of Hopkinton. At a town
meeting held in 1781, it was voted that
the price of a day’s work on the highway,
by a man, should be $30; the price of a
day’s work by a yoke of oxen, $30; the
price of a plow and cart, $10 each.
The salary of the Rev. Elijah Fletcher,
second minister of the town, was also
voted to be $4000 for the year, but the
reverend pastor preferred to accept £70
in gold equivalents, and declined the
larger nominal sum. The success of
the American cause, and the permanent
establishment of the public credit, gave
a correspondingly improved aspect to
local affairs, and in later times this town
has experienced fluctuations in prices
in common with the general country.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the period of Hopkinton’s
greater importance as a commercial station,
a bank was maintained here for a few
years. The institution was known as
the Franklin Bank, and was incorporated
in 1833. The grantees were Horace
Chase, Nathaniel Gilman, Isaac Long,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Jr., William Little, Joseph Stanwood,
Matthew Harvey, Andrew Leach, Moses
Gould, Ebenezer Dustin, Timothy
Chandler, Stephen Darling, and James
Huse. The operations of this bank seem
to have been exceedingly bungling during
the short term of its existence, and it
finally settled with its creditors at ninety
cents on a dollar. The Franklin Bank
occupied the building now used by the
Hopkinton Public Library.</p>

<p class='c005'>The standard of quantities to be recognized
in commercial transactions has,
from remote times, been a subject of
legal regulation. The weights and measures
first used in this town were the
standards of older communities. In a
record made in the year 1804, the town
of Hopkinton declared the local standard
to be as follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>

<p class='c005'>For the use of the above weights the
town recognized “two small scale beams
with brass dishes,” and also “one large
scale beam with boards, and strung with
iron wires.” The <em>wooden dry measures</em>
were specific as 1 half-bushel, 1 peck,
1 half-peck, 1 two-quart, and 1 quart;
while the <em>copper liquid measures</em> were
started to be 1 gallon, 1 two-quart, 1
quart, 1 pint, 1 half-pint, and 1 gill.</p>

<p class='c005'>By legal requirement, the standard of
weights and measures is regulated by a
town sealer to this day, such officer
being chosen annually at the town-meeting
in March, but the modern
improvements and facilities for determining
quantities have made a practically
dead letter of the present law requiring
his selection.</p>

<p class='c005'>For many years a public hay-scales
occupied a site in the rear of the
Congregational meeting-house. It was
simply an immense scale beam and
platform, the whole apparatus being
covered with a roof. It long ago passed
away to give place to the modern hay-scales.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>POLITICAL.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the earlier history of this town,
politics and religion were closely related.
For many years the affairs of the legally
established, or Congregational, church
were arranged by vote of the town.
The intimate relation existing between
the church and the town made the
meeting-house and town-house at first
identical. The earliest town-meeting
held in the first meeting-house was on
the 2d of March, 1767. Previously,
town-meetings had been held at private
houses. Town-meetings continued to
be held in the church till 1799, when
use was first made of the old Hillsborough
county Court House, the
annual meeting of that year being held
in the upper room of the county edifice.
Town-meeting has since been held
annually on the same spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the time of the incorporation of
the town, in 1765, annual town-meetings
were legally held only on the first Monday
in March. In the year 1803, the
State legislature fixed the date of annual
town-meetings at the second Tuesday
of the same month. Till the year 1813,
when the State established a law requiring
the use of an alphabetical list
of voters at town-meetings, public legal
gatherings in town had been conducted
with less formality than has been maintained
since, but the regard for parliamentary
proprieties had been sufficient
to prevent any disorder or unskillfulness
of a serious nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>The instincts of the people of this
town have always largely partaken of a
Democratic character. There has been
a prominent jealousy of individual
rights. This feature of local political
life was exhibited in the very earliest
times, when individuals frequently appeared
at the moderator’s desk to record
their names in opposition to some
measure or other passed by the majority.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Even to this day the doctrine of individual
rights is strongly asserted by the
mass of persons of whatever party
name. In the days of the prolonged
supremacy of the Democratic party,
the lines of party distinction were drawn
so clearly that scarcely a Whig was ever
permitted to represent the town at the
General Court. Once, in 1844, there
was a kind of general compromise between
parties, and Moses Colby, a Whig,
and Samuel Colby, a Democrat, were sent
to the legislature together. For quite
a number of years there was a compromise
on the subject of selectmen,
and a general consent gave the Whigs annually
one member in a board of three;
but this arrangement was broken up by
a fancied or real attempt of the Whigs
to take more than their customarily allotted
portion of the chosen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Till the year 1855, when the Democrats
lost the general control of political
affairs in town for the first time, the constantly
prevailing superiority had prevented
the practice or necessity of much
caucusing. A few leading ones put
their heads together and gave a definite
impulse to the party movement. The
process worked very well, except when
now and then an accident would happen,
as, for instance, when a refractory candidate
insisted in pushing his private
claims at all hazards. Caucusing,
however, had been practiced more or
less previously to 1855, but since this
date the closeness of the popular vote
has often led to a degree of figuring and
planning that can be easily comprehended
by all accustomed to watch the
movements of political leadership in
New Hampshire during the last quarter
of a century.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have shown, in a previous article,
that the Democrats of this town held a
majority on the Governor’s vote till
1865. However, in 1855, the American
party elected two representatives—Paul
R. George and Timothy Colby—and
three selectmen.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>[This article from Miss Connor, written from Malaga last summer, having been mislaid, after its reception,
is published at this time as not without interest, notwithstanding the delay.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</span></p>

<p class='c005'>The streets of Malaga always present
an animated appearance. One
never sees here that dead calm which
pervades many of our northern cities
in midsummer. At all hours of the
day the air resounds with the sonorous
voices of men and boys calling out
whatever they may have to sell. Fish
of all kinds, fruits, live turkeys and
many other things may be obtained in
this way, with the additional entertainment
of listening to a loud and heated
discussion between the servant and
vender regarding the price. If the latter
chances to be a boy, he summons a
flood of tears to his assistance, having
acquired, as a part of his occupation,
the faculty of crying when occasion demands.
The servant, accustomed to
mechanical weeping, is immovable and
the youthful imposter is finally compelled
to receive a fair price for his
wares.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every afternoon at five o’clock, an
old man with a bright, cheerful face
passes our window calling out “barquillos”
in a clear, musical voice which
makes itself heard at a long distance.
The children crowd around him while
he takes from a green box strapped
over his shoulder, a tube made of light
paste, on one end of which he puts a
white foamy substance, composed of
the whites of eggs and sugar. At this
juncture, the little ones become frantic
and jostle each other in a most unceremonious
manner, in their eagerness to
possess the delicate morsel. Each one
is served and the poor old man goes
on his way rejoicing ever the few
quartas which will buy his daily bread.
Barquillos are also obtained at restaurants
as an accompaniment for ices,
and seem to be relished by children of
a larger growth, as well as others.</p>

<p class='c005'>The business of the ware houses
commences at an early hour and continues
through the day; carts drawn by
mules are constantly passing while the
industrious little donkeys may be seen
marching in a line, following their leader,
who has a bell to announce his
coming. During the vintage, long lines
of donkeys laden with boxes of raisins
come from the vineyards, horses never
being used except in cabs and private
carriages. The cab horses are poor,
old animals which seem to have lived
as long as nature intended, but are
kept alive by some mysterious agency,
and by dint of much urging and whipping
manage to move at a slow pace.
One day, when we were taking a drive,
the horse suddenly stopped and the
driver dismounted. To our inquiry, as to
the cause of delay he replied, “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">no es
nada</span></i>” (it is nothing), resumed his seat
and we started again, but had not proceeded
far when the animal absolutely
refused to go; this time we insisted upon
alighting and were coolly informed
that the horse was only a little <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">cansado</span></i>
(tired). Many more instances might
be cited illustrating the manner in
which dumb animals are abused in a
country where there are no laws prohibiting
it, or if such laws exist they are
not enforced.</p>

<p class='c005'>The animation prevailing through
the day by no means diminishes as
night approaches, although of a very
different character. At twilight, the
higher classes sally forth to the Alameda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>or Muelle (mole), to enjoy the refreshing
breeze from the sea, while
those of lower estate seek some place
of rendezvous and indulge in their idle
gossip. An occasional troubadour
steals to some obscure corner and
sends forth plaintive sounds from his
faithful guitar, not unfrequently some
youthful swain is inspired to add the
charms of his voice, and the “Malaguenas”
bursts forth in all its primative
sweetness. The enthusiasm of the
Spaniards on hearing their national airs
is something remarkable, they become
quite wild with excitement and applaud
in the most vociferous manner. Foreigners,
also, who have spent some
time in the country, share this enthusiasm,
which seems to be caused more
by a certain rhythmical peculiarity, than
by any extraordinary merit of the music
itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>The romantic days of Spain are past,
when the lover stood beneath the balcony
of his sweetheart, wooing her
with the gentle strains of his guitar. To
us it seems a matter of regret that this
ancient custom no longer exists, but it
undoubtedly relieves many anxious
parents as it particularly favored clandestine
courtships. A Spanish gentleman
of our acquaintance who is blessed
with seven daughters, and occupies a
house containing twenty balconies,
congratulates himself upon the change
in love-making as it would be impossible
to keep watch over all, even by
constantly rushing from one balcony to
another. At the present day the suitor
is admitted to the salon, where he may
converse with the object of his affections,
but always in the presence of her
parents. Spanish mammas would be
shocked at the freedom allowed American
girls in receiving visits from the
opposite sex and accepting their escort
to places of entertainment.</p>

<p class='c005'>The feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated
in Malaga with much <em>eclat</em>. For
two weeks previous preparations were
going on for the fair, which takes
place at this time, booths being arranged
on one side of the Alameda and
filled with a variety of articles, useful
and ornamental, calculated to please
the eye and lighten the pockets of
passers-by, while others were provided
with these substantial things needful to
satisfy the wants of the inner man. At
night the Alameda was most brilliantly
illuminated by long lines of lights extending
the whole length on either side,
also across the centre at intervals, with
occasional circles and clusters, producing
a most dazzling effect. At each
end, in front of the fountains were
erected two pavillions, one under the
direction of a club styled the “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Circulo
Mercantil</span>,” the other by the members
of the “Lycio” both of which were
handsomely decorated with flags and
flowers and provided with comfortable
seats. We availed ourselves of the opportunity
to attend the balls given in
these pavillions, and found them exceedingly
diverting. In the centre, a
space was reserved for the dancers,
who tripped the “light fantastic” with
apparent enjoyment, notwithstanding
the disadvantages of little room and
much heat. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toilettes</span></i> of the ladies
were varied and elegant, displaying a
taste which would do credit to Worth
himself, while the national costume,
worn by a few young ladies, far exceeded
the most charming conceptions of
that famous artist. This costume, called
the “<em>Maja</em>,” is extremely picturesque,
especially when combined with
the piquant faces and nonchalant airs
of the Spanish girls. It consists of a
skirt of bright red or blue satin, edged
with a broad trimming of black <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chenille</span></i>;
with this is worn a black velvet bodice,
the hair is arranged in finger puffs, with
a high comb placed jauntily on one
side, and a few flowers gracefully twined
among the dark tresses; a Spanish
mantilla, and laced slippers, just disclosed
beneath the short skirt, complete
this beautiful costume, rich in fabric,
but simple in design, and above all allowing
a graceful freedom which our
present straight laced fashions render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>impossible. Weary of the brilliancy
and animation of the ballroom, we
passed to the garden where tables were
arranged for refreshments, and amid
the sound of inspiring music and the
gentle murmur of the fountain, partook
of delicate viands served by attentive
waiters. The arrangement of
these pavillions was perfect in every respect,
contributing in the highest degree
to the comfort of the guests, and
long shall we bear in remembrance the
pleasant evenings they afforded us.</p>

<p class='c005'>On Corpus Christi day a long and
imposing procession marched through
the principal streets, carrying an image
of the “Virgin” robed in black velvet
elaborately embroidered in gold, and a
large “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Custodia</span></i>” of solid silver containing
the “<em>host</em>.” The clergy, in
their clerical gowns, with their faces
plump and glossy, walked along in a
self-satisfied manner, confident of good
cheer in this world, whatever may
await them in another. The civil and
military authorities added their dignified
presence, followed by a large concourse
of people with wax candles.
The streets and balconies were filled
with men, women, and children of all
ages and classes, every available space
being occupied. In the afternoon a
bull fight took place, and a ball in the
evening ended the programme of the
day.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the midst of the festivities of the
week, the Queen’s illness was announced,
causing a suspension of all
gayety, and her subsequent death was
followed by a season of mourning. The
Alameda was stripped of its superfluous
adornings, and the sound of music no
longer filled the air with its sweet harmonies.
Funeral services were solemnized
in the Cathedral, and many a
fervent prayer ascended to Heaven for
the repose of the dead, and the resignation
of the bereaved young King.</p>
